Welcome to **SalesRPM**, a Power BI project created as part of my internship. This analysis dives deep into car sales data to evaluate brand performance, fuel preferences, and market trends across various automotive companies.

This repository contains the entire workflow—from raw data processing in Excel to dynamic visual dashboards built in Power BI. The insights generated are useful for business decision-making, marketing strategies, and consumer behavior understanding in the automobile sector.

## 📌 Project Objective

The goal of this project was to analyze a comprehensive car sales dataset to:

- Evaluate overall sales performance of different car brands.
- Understand fuel-type trends (Petrol, Diesel, Hybrid, etc.).
- Analyze the impact of transmission types on sales.
- Monitor year-wise trends in car sales, tax, MPG, and price.
- Provide brand-specific insights for strategic analysis.

This was my **first task during the internship**, where I was responsible for building a complete data analysis solution using Excel and Power BI.
